# Warning #

this is a prototype = messy, messy code that is thrown away in the finished product.
The idea of this project:

* see if I could use OpenGL (drawing, responding to user input) at least for 2D, and basics of understanding of 3D, geometry and data types.
* 2D physics engine Chipmunk
* sound with OpenAL
* texture (TODO)

and all this in Haskell.
This is also meant to allow me to ask stupid questions to people while pointing at actual bits of code.
